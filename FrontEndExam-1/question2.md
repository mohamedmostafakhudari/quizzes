- Abstraction is the concept that we use to represent the essential features of an entity with the help of interface without including the implementation details

2 - F

- Abstraction mainly focuses on what the object does instead of how it does it

3 - F

- This is the job of Encapsulation concept to hide the internal details of an object and only exposes a few interaction points like the essential methods defined in an interface (Abstraction). Imagine a device and it's buttons designed for a regular user to be able to interact with the device without knowledge about how it works internally.

- Overriding is a run-time polymorphism.

5 - F

- Overloading is a compile-time polymorphism

6 - T

- Overloading decide which method to be called when multiple methods with the same name but different signatures is called so it's using static binding and this process happens at compile-time stage

- Overriding is about changing the implementation of a method in a child class during the run-time of the program so it's using dynamic binding

7 - T

- Encapsulation is about grouping related state and behavior in a single unit.

8 - T

- Poly means many, morph means forms, so it means many forms. And yes it allow us to use the same function or method in many different ways either by overloading the methods with different signatures or overriding the parent's methods in the child class with new implementation fits the child object needs.
